# Working-DayCal


### Description
This repo is for the UCLA fullstack program bootcamp, module 5. <br>
This program allows users to assign themselves task by the typical work day hour<br>
It does this by locally saving user inputs and then applying them on page reload<br>
Additionally the page tracks the date, and the time via color coded hour blocks<br>
The module 5 assignment provides the following as a guideline and criteria for the assignment:

### User Story
AS AN employee with a busy schedule<br>
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner<br>
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively<br>

### Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule<br>
WHEN I open the planner<br>
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar<br>
WHEN I scroll down<br>
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours<br>
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day<br>
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future<br>
WHEN I click into a time block<br>
THEN I can enter an event<br>
WHEN I click the save button for that time block<br>
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage<br>
WHEN I refresh the page<br>
THEN the saved events persist<br>
